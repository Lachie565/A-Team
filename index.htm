       <p><h3> Dario's review of Team member test results:</h3></p><br>

       <p>Test outcomes can be great starting point in forming a picture about  someone’s  profile.
          This is what I learned about group members by reading their test results.</p><br>
<p><i>Kunpeng XU:</i></p>
<p>Looking through tests I can see a good personality for working in a team and an introvert person whick also tells me that he will be calm if any arguments pop up.
I also noted that his way of learning is visual and I'll keep that in mind.</p><br>

<p><i>Aaron Moyle:</i></p>
<p>Aaron test results show that he is a visual lerner and also that he has a great rate on intellect/imagination and power of being able to work out proper ways to make agreements.</p>
<p>Great assets for teamwork!!</p><br>

<p><i>Lachlan Cottrell:</i></p>
<p>According to Lachlans test results I can see a creative person which is great learner through reading and listening. The fact that making decisions scale is more on the side of the feelings then thinking shows that person has a soul and every team can have a great benefits with person like that in it to make overall decisions more righteous.</p>

         <p>I was born in regional Victoria, growing up in the town of Mildura.</p>
         <p>I have lived here most of my life, I have 12 cousins which I grew up with here. My whole family lives in the Mildura region. I completed Year 12 at Coomealla High School in 2012, I then worked on farms up until 2020 when I started an apprenticeship as a Diesel Mechanic. I am the third generation of farmers in my family, with my grandfather being a pioneer in table grape export industry in the 80’s. My father and his two brothers are still farming locally today. One of my favourite past times is Golf, Mildura is a golfers dream with access to 6 courses in the area. </p>

         <p><h3> Lachlan's review of Team member test results:</h3></p><br>


  <p><i>Kunpeng XU:</i></p>
  <p>Kunpeng’s test results show an introverted yet assertive individual with a preference for visual learning. I think this combination of personality traits is great in a group environment, he’s very unlikely to speak excessively. When he does speak though, everyone will listen as he is indicated to be a person careful with his words.</p><br>

  <p><i>Aaron Moyle:</i></p>
  <p>Aaron’s test results show a big personality, he is not shy of sharing his feelings. Although he is extroverted, he is also agreeable and not stubborn in his actions. This is great for group work as he is equipped to share his thoughts without overriding the other members. </p><br>

  <p><i>Dario Moconja</i></p>
  <p>In looking at Dario’s test results, he is a born leader. I think his personality suits that of a group leader perfectly, having an assertive yet intuitive personality is very useful when it comes to making sure work is completed on time. </p>

   <p><i>Aaron Moyle:</i></p>
   <p>Aaron’s test results are showing he is a person who have an extremely high passion on something. And he also can be the decision maker in the group.</p><br>

   <p><i>Lachlan Cottrell:</i></p>
   <p>From the result of Lachlan, he could create many ideas, as he is good as listening and collected helpful information. After the deep consideration, he would explore more creative ideas, which is helpful for the group member to develop the assignment effectively</p><br>

   <p><i>Dario Moconja</i></p>
   <p>Dario’s results are showing he is a really confident person, and he has the potential to be the leadership in the group. He could manage the group members with a reasonable way, and these personalities can make up the group member who is introverted. </p>

          <p>I’m 22 Born in Australia, I’m currently studying at RMIT University</p>
          <p>Last forum of education I had was a Diploma of interactive media and Game Design in 2018 before working for my brother-in-law for his company Wafflesoft, where we started the design on the project “Outback Survival”. </p>
          <p>I moved my interests away from game design and closer towards AI Design, though I wouldn’t be able to communicate with other AI scientists around the world as I can only speak one language Fluently despite going around the world, I would probably need an Interpreter Ha-ha.</p>
